# SpigotPlugin-Realtime
## A spigot plugin that can synchronize day and night changes in Minecraft with the real world.
</p>This plugin develop based on Minecraft 1.12.2(Spigot), but it run perfectly in my Spigot 1.8.8 server.
I guess it can run in a higher minecraft version, because I didn't use any outdate method, but I didn't test.
If you got any problems when using the plugin, welcome message.</p>

### config.yml
```Yaml
sync-time-enable: true   #Is the time synchronization funtion enabled.
sync-time-sec: 10   #How long should server sync the time.(Second)
no-weather-change: false   #Is the weather lock function enabled.
```
